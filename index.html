        <h3>WHAT IS SPACE EXPLORATION</h3>
        <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space.While the exploration
            of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration though is conducted
            both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form
            astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science.

                    the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first flyby was the 1961 Venera 1,
                    though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby to successfully return data. Mariner 2 has been
                    followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus
                    flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies. In 1967 Venera 4 became
                    the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, Venera 7 became the
                    first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight
                    additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data.
                    Starting in 1975 with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9 some ten successful orbiter missions have been
                    sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to
                    pierce the obscuring atmosphere.

                    In 1959 the Soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon, never previously visible
                    to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger 4 impactor in 1962. Starting in
                    1966 the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain
                    data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later, Surveyor 1 marked the debut of a
                    successful series of U.S.
                    <br><br>
                    Crewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the Apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the
                    Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, the Apollo 11
                    mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did
                    not continue for long. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent
                    human visit. Artemis 2 will flyby the Moon in 2022. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously.

                    The exploration of <strong>Mars</strong> has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet
                    Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Dozens of robotic spacecraft,

                    missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the
                    history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a
                    better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible
                    future, of Earth.Mars is the prime candidate where humans could live outside the Earth and the
                    technology to reach Mars is possible.
                    <br><br>
                    The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all
                    spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they
                    even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of
                    variables involved in an interplanetary journey
                    <br><br>
                    In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars, India has become the first
                    country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)[40][41][42] is
                    one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of
                    ₹ 450 Crore (US$73 million).
